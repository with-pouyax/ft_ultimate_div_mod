# ft_ultimate_div_mod

The `ft_div_mod` function is a practical example of how to use pointers for basic arithmetic operations in C. This repository contains the `ft_div_mod` function, which efficiently demonstrates division and modulus operations, storing the results through pointer parameters.

## Description

`ft_div_mod` performs integer division and modulus operations on two integers, `a` and `b`, and stores the results in two separate variables through their pointers, `div` for division and `mod` for modulus. This function showcases the effective use of pointers to return multiple outcomes from a function, a common pattern in C programming.
